# Udemy React Projects

A repository for all the projects built alongside Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

The course was structured into 27 sections. Each section tackles a topic of React, being taught through a small project which you complete throughout the section. You are taught the topic, walked through the starting files of the project, then encouraged to do as much of the project as you can on your own before viewing the lectures for a walked-through solution. For the most part, this is the approach I followed, though for a better showing of my coding skills, I recommend you look through my other repositories :)  

Note that not every section has a project, as some sections are more theoretical and don't require practical learning. For these, I made some brief notes on my personal OneNote Notebook.

All projects can be cloned and ran from VS Code, as long as all dependencies are installed using ```npm install```. Note that some projects are built using Firebase or MongoDB as dummy backends. These projects will no longer work, due to the backends now being taken down.

### Section 10: Side Effects, Reducers and Context
<a name="s10" />

*Project: [Basic Authentication Page](./10-advanced-react-hooks)*

Working with more advanced react hooks, such as useEffect, useReducer and useContext. All of these are combined to create a basic authentication page, complete with form and error handling, and a dynamic UI.

<hr />

### Section 11: Practice Project - Food Order App
<a name="s11" />

*Project: [Food Order App](./11-food-order-app)*
